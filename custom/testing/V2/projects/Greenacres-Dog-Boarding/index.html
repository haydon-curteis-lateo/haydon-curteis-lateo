    <h1 class="title">Greenacres Dog Boarding</h1>
    <h3 class="subTitle">Designed | Developed | Perfected</h3>
    <p class="explanation">For Greenacres Dog Boarding I wanted to makesure that any theme I chose would suit the atmosphere of the business.
    When speaking to Greenacres Dog Boarding I learnt that it was a very happy and welcoming company.
    So for the website I wanted to makesure that it had a warm and welcoming atmosphere inviting in the user.
    For that reason the design would have to be something soft and gentle, there could be no sudden movements or jumps. Greenacres Dog Boarding also has a wide age range of customers, for this reason the design could not be something over complicated it would have to be simple and basic.
    This would allow for it to be understandable for any age range.
