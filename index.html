        <p>Hi, I'm Haydon and I enjoy ICT, I have a passion for everything to do with it, whether that's building a computer to using one to build programs and websites like this one. I like to think that I'm organised, responsible and determined. I use these traits in my day to day life to keep me at my best state, whether that allows me to create something which is challenging and frustrating or as simple as just making me keep going through the day. I like to explore my creativity and imagination to see how far I can push my knowledge and skill. This website is an example of that I will be using it to see what I am capable of, find my limits and then overcome them, and to repeat that until I no longer have any limits.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I have learnt the majority of all my knowledge about ICT from just the internet, but going to college has opened me up to new information and creations, I took it upon myself to find out more about the information they provided and improve my skill in those areas, I hope to further the extent of my knowledge through progressing my time at college and maybe moving on to go to university. My end goal is to be able to have a successful career in ICT and be able to work doing what I enjoy, I might not be very good at certain areas yet but with my three key personality traits I have determination to one day reach my goal and look back on my life with relief and happiness.</p>
